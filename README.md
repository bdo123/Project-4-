## Project Overview

### What We're Building
We built a complete, functional system to enhance the UMD football game day experience. The system allows users to:

- View all food offerings at SECU Stadium on game days.
- See images and nutritional information for each item.
- Filter by dietary restrictions or health-conscious choices.
- Get suggestions for healthier alternatives.
- Persist menu data and generate reports and summaries.

### Problem Domain
Fans attending UMD football games face challenges:

1. Nutritional information is often missing at concessions.
2. Health-conscious or restricted-diet individuals struggle to make informed choices.
3. Patrons cannot see food visuals before purchasing.

Goal: Provide an interactive, visual, and informative menu system to make game day food choices easy, healthy, and engaging.

## System Features
- Complete Workflows: Users can browse, filter, and select menu items from start to finish.
- Data Persistence: Menu data can be saved and loaded (XML format).
- Import/Export: Export summaries and reports for easy access.
- Interactive Visualization: See nutrition breakdowns visually.
- Professional Quality: Clean, maintainable code with error handling and testing.
